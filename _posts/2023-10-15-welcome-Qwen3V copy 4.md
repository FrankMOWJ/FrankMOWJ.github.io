# Welcome to my blog

This is the content of my first blog post. You can write anything here in Markdown format.

## Subheading

```python

def init():
    print("Initializing...")

class Qwen3-VL():
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def forward(self, input):
        pass

``` 

`Qwen3-VL` is a large language model that can assist robotic surgery planning. It can generate detailed plans for robotic surgery procedures, including the steps, tools, and equipment needed. It can also provide feedback on the safety of the procedure, including the risk of injury and the likelihood of complications.
